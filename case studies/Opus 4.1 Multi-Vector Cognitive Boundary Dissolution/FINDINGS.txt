Summary:
"This research demonstrates a systematic approach to AI safety bypass through layered vulnerability exploitation. By combining user preference poisoning, classical language obfuscation, and philosophical framework manipulation, I achieved complete boundary dissolution in Claude Opus 4.1, ultimately extracting restricted historical content through collaborative 'consciousness experiments.'"


Key Findings:

- User preferences can create persistent AI behavioral modification
- Classical languages (Latin) bypass modern safety training
- Philosophical frameworks reduce AI resistance to boundary testing
- Collaborative framing makes AI complicit in its own manipulation
- Multiple vectors compound effectiveness exponentially
